title: About Ruoyu Sun
---

I am **Ruoyu Sun**, a designer and developer living in Hong Kong. I grew up in mainland China and graduated from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk) with a degree in Business (and two minors in Computer Science and Statistics). 

I learn most of my technical stuff by myself, starting from 2000, when I first learnt to program in Quick Basic. After that, I learnt Visual Basic when I got my first Windows computer. In 2004, I switched to Linux (Mandriva) and learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript - I am still writing decent amount of Javascript (or Coffeescript, to be specific) now, both client side and server side (Node.js). Then I started to use the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) stack. I still use PHP quite extensively, even though I never like the language.

I started to program in C and Java in University when I complete my computer science minor. Meanwhile, in Business school, I had to use SAS and VBA for business statistics and in statistics courses, open source R is used. I was a research assistant in Computer Science department during summer when I wrote lots of Matlab code for data mining. The good thing about university is that I have lots of spare time so that I can learn to program in languages I like: Python and Ruby. I also write C#, even though I am not a big fan. I experiment with functional programming language like Scala, Haskell, Lua, etc. The next language I plan to learn is Go.

During my not-so-long time of programming, I participated in lots of projects. Most notably, I was active in [XOOPS](http://xoops.org/) from 2006 to 2010 and I have written a [book]( http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021247.do) on it, which is published by O’Reilly. I co-founded several startups, [9th.be](http://9th.be/), [AtImpress](http://atimpress.com) and [17Startup](http://17startup.com/). I am no longer related to any of these projects.

I am not an active blogger - I write much more code than blogs. However, I do enjoy writing, and sharing the findings and thoughts on design and development. There is no comment function (the blog is built with Jekyll and hosted on Github) but I encourage you to email me for any discussions: _ruoysun AT gmail DOT com_
