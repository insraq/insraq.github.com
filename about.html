Currently, I live in Helsinki (Finland) and work in a [game engine](http://unity3d.com) company. Before that, I worked
in a [game studio](http://wargaming.net), started my own investment banking and technology (or *fintech* if you will)
[*startup*](https://alpha.huaxing.com/) and worked in a [Suisse investment bank](http://credit-suisse.com). 

In my free time, I run [Fish Pond Studio](https://fishpondstudio.com/), a one-man independent game studio.
I also like cooking and recipe developing and my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/insraq/) is pretty much dedicated to that.

I attended [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk) with a degree in Business (and two minors in Computer Science and Statistics). I am on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/insraq), [Github](https://github.com/insraq) and
[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/ruoyu-sun/27/6b6/b8). I can also be reach by email **hi @ ruoyusun . com**
